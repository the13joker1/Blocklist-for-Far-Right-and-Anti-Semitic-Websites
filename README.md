# Anti-Extremism and Anti-Anti-Semitism Blocklist

This repository contains a blocklist of domains associated with far-right, extremist, and anti-Semitic content. The list can be used with popular content blockers like [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) or [LeechBlock NG](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/leechblock-ng/) to block websites that promote harmful ideologies.

## Features

- Blocks a wide range of far-right, extremist, and anti-Semitic domains.
